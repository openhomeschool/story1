The Return of the Condiment King
      The Further Adventures In Candiland As Followed the Wild Adventure detailed beforehand
     
From The Daily Diary of The Condiment King
      All Tresspassers upon my condimentish privacy shall be sprayed with ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish.
      You having been turned into a hotdog, I shall eat you with relish!
      Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      
      Darling, dearest diary . . . . .
           After our condiment haven was nuked, I retreated into the great pickle relish factory.  I am known there as St. Pickles.  The workers welcomed me gladly.  Those silly fools who blew up our haven thought I was dead.  I made myself a bed of ketchup and a pillow of mustard, mayonnaise was my blanket.   Pickle relish constituted my clothes, and sriracha and hotsauce made a carpet by my feet.  My condimentish peace was not to last, however . . .
           
           -From the Mad Condiment Diaries, put together by Thomas  Lars, "Larry" Butterscotch, boy genius
           Address : 203 Licorice Lane, Lollipopilis, Candiland Planet, The Sweet Solar System, The Milky Way Galaxy, the Universe, 
           Compiled in The Year 4000 A.D.E. (After the Discovery of Electricity) It is now the year 8000 ADE and their time is considered medieval Candiland
           
           ROSALIND
           six months after the "defeat" of the condiment king . . . . .
           
           Fifteen year old Rosalind Cassandra Butterscotch looked left, right, and ran.  She dragged her five-year-old brother, Larry, across the street- Caramel Lickin' Lane, and slowed to a walk on the other side.
           "We wouldn't have to walk across the street if we had a yellowmobile," Larry whined.  He had wanted a yellowmobile ever since he had heard about it from his best friend, Bananaman, who had, coincidntally, a yellowmobile.
           
           Rosalind sighed.  "Thomas Lars Butterscotch, you know we can't have a yellowmobile because we don't have enough money, okay?  Remember that you're a hero now and you have to be responsible."
           "but Bananama-"
           Rosalind cut him off.  "just because Bananaman has it doesn't mean you get it, Larry.  Also," she sighed and stopped talking.  It was kind of pointless when she had tried to tell him many times.  Bananaman was a thirty-year-old, unmarried, crazy individual (Rosalind kept hoping that he would get married and calm down but it hadn't happened yet.), with a taste for strange cars.    He additionally thought himself a superhero, and Larry thought himself to be Bananaman's sidekick.  At five, Rosalind didn't consider him to be old enough to do such a thing, even if he was unusually smart for his age--boy genius, some called him.
           
           Even though Rosalind, Larry, and the Bananaman had saved Candiland from a villain- The Condiment King, just six months beforehand, along with another boy- a sixteen year old pilot named Friedrick David Biscotti IV, Larry had not played much of a part in it.  Larry had been four at the time, and rather oblivious to the D.B.C. (destruction by condiments) going on around him.  The only part he had played was to trip the CK, allowing Friedrick time enough to nuke the secluded Condiment Haven.  They had not spotted him since, and CK was presumed dead.  But Rosalind and Friedrick, the only sensible ones of their group, thought that the newspapers had false assumptions and were constantly on the lookout for CK.
           
           Rosalind was yanked back to the present by Larry pulling her arm.
           "Larry," she said, annoyed,"  you don't have to yank my arm out of its socket every time you want my attention."
           "It's urgent, Rosa," he told her.
           "What is it?"
           He pointed.
           In the distance, a red, yellow, greeny-white smudge could be seen against the perfect, swirled pink and white of the Candiland sky.  
           A cape could clearly be seen against the smudge.  Its bold, easy to read letters declared
           
           CONDIMENT KING
           
           Rosalind, stunned by the return of this enemy, let her gaze slide for a moment to the right of this strange sight, to see an even stranger sight.  A golden yellow figure soared through the air, emitting bananas? from its banana shaped boots.
           
           She sprang into action.  Pulling her chocolate communication device (CCD) out of her pocket and called, first 555 (the emergency number) and then Friedrick's number.
           "Hello," she babbled instantly when the CCD stopped ringing, "Reappearance of CK, help needed chop chop!  City block marmalade12!"  then she called Friedrick.
            "Friedrick, CK has reappeared."
            "Vantage point?" asked Friedrick's quiet bass voice.
            "Block marmalade12, in front of the icecream shop.  Bananaman is also on the scene."
            "Got it, on my way.  Oh..and any visible weapons?"
            "Just the usual."
            Rosalind's CCD beeped and said 
            "call ended".
            
            She pocketed it and began to wait for Friedrick to arrive.
            
            As she waited the CK began to throw little hand grenades made of condiments, (yes, condiments are highly radioactive and can explode if brushed the wrong way) at various places in Lollipopilis.
            
            She began to sweat terribly as she watched places she loved be destroyed.  
            Then she turned, to make sure Larry was okay,
            
            but he was gone!
            
            FRIEDRICK
				
			 Friedrick pulled his plane out of the hanger and down the runway.
			 
			 Would he be late?  he wondered.  Would Rosalind, Bananaman, and Larry already be dead when he got to the scene?
			 
			 BANANAMAN
			 
			 Heroically, with a little flourish, Bananaman pulled his banana sting gun from his belt and peppered the CK with electrically charged bananas.  They bounced right off his bubble of condiments that the CK controlled with his mind.
			 
			 Bananaman cartwheeled gleefully, (after all, his aim was nearly always poor) and immediately regretted it, since it made his banana rocket boots short-circuit.
			 
			 As he began to plummet, he wondered what his last words would be before he hit the rock candy pavement.  He'd always wanted to die heroically.  This was NOT what he had in mind.
			 
			 LARRY
			 
			 As soon as Larry saw Bananaman, heroically flying through the pink and white swirled sky, he began to sprint towards Bananaman's barely visible yellowmobile in the distance.  Bananaman needed Larry!  As Larry reached the yellowmobile, he leaped into the cockpit and opened the wings.  He fired up the engine and took off.
			 
			 BANANAMAN
			 
			 "I'm too young to die!" shrieked Bananaman as he hit what he thought was the pavement, which was surprisingly comfortable.
			 Bananaman opened his eyes to see himself in his yellowmobile and in the passenger seat.  Larry, or Bananaboy, was driving.  The CK could be seen in the distance, still bombing the city.
			 
			 Bananaman took a few seconds to recover, then he patted Bananaboy on the back.
			 
			 "Good work!" he cried.  "I owe you my life!"
			 Bananaboy blushed and shot CK with a bomb, disabling the condiment shield.
			 Bananaman knew when to take the stage.
			 
			 He rebooted his boots and shot up to confront the CK.
			 He heard the bananaman theme song start to play, though that may have been his imagination.
			
			INSERT : The bananaman theme song
			(to be sung to the tune of "Yankee doodle", "Jingle bells", "Camptown races" or whatever tune strikes your fancy):
			
			BANANAMAN IS SUPER COOL, HE CAN TAKE WHATEVER HITS HIM.
			 BANANAMAN CAN KILL THE BAD GUYS, AND RESCUE THE LADIES
			 LA DEE DAH, LA DEE DAH, LALALALALALALALALALALALALA
			  PRAISE BANANAS!  PRAISE THE BANANAMAN!!!!
			 HE IS THE BAD GUYS' WORST NIGHTMARE
			 AND HE HAS COOL HAIR!
			 LA DEE DAH, LA DEE DAH, LALALALALALALALALALALALALA
			 PRAISE BANANAS!  PRAISE THE BANANAMAN!!!!
			 BANANAMAN IS THE GREATEST, BANANAMAN IS THE BEST
			 BANANAMAN IS BETTER THAN ALL THE OTHER HEROES!!!!
			 LA DEE DAH, LA DEE DAH, LALALALALALALALALALALALALA 
			 PRAISE BANANAS!  PRAISE THE BANANAMAN!!!!
			 OH BOY, HERE COMES BANANAMAN TO SAVE THE DAY!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	       NO ONE CAN DENY THAT BANANAMAN IS THE BEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEEESSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSSTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTTT!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
	       LA DEE DAH, LA DEE DAH, LALALALALALALALALALALALALA 
	       PRAISE BANANAS!  PRAISE THE BANANAMAN!!!!
	       LA DEEEEEEE, LA DEE DAH DAH, LALALA, LA DEE DAH DEE DAH DEE DAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAAHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHHH!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
			 
			 ROSALIND
			 
			 Rosalind, panicking, felt a strong hand grab the back of her shirt and hoist her into the cockpit of a plane.
			 
			 "Hello, Rosa," said a deep voice--Friedrick's voice.
			 
			 Now that she was situated slightly higher, Rosalind could see Larry and  Bananaman in the Bananaman's yellowmobile.
			 She was relieved that they were both alive--for now, at least.
			 
			 But then she saw the Bananaman leap into the air in the most heroic mood she'd ever seen him in, in his determination to defeat CK, and Rosalind gasped in admiration and fear.  (she also heard Larry start to play the bananaman theme song.  she rolled her eyes)
			 
			 -------------------------------------------------------
			 
			 The details of the last battle between CK and the Bananaman are too long and laborious to be put into many words.  Let it suffice to say that Bananaman died a hero, but a commercial.  His last words reflected how he had lived, and he would have appreciated them.  they were
			 "eat bananas, smell bananas, and be bananas!" before he crumpled heroically in a mush of banana.
			 
			 the CK died rather anticlimactically.  he fell from the sky after his final grapple with the Bananaman, and his final words were
			 "Long live ST. PICKLES!"
			 
			 -------------------------------------------------------
And What Happened After:


			Larry was heartbroken, until he found another superhero, (Appleman)  to adore, worship, and be a sidekick to.  He always remembered Bananaman with fondness.  When he grew up, he became a lame superhero, just like his model, Bananaman.  He called himself Plumman.
			 He eventually married another superhero, a wacky woman called Peachy, though her actual name was Lulu Doodle.  They had a whole kaboodle of kids, who were all as wacky as them, except two, a boy and a girl, who did not deserve their horriible names, which were Lima and Beanie.  Yes, all their kids had names like that.
			
			
			
			Friedrick became famous for his air exploits, and Rosalind became the first woman from Candiland to visit Earth.  She landed in medieval England, and met Shakespeare, who named one of his characters after her.
			 
			 Friedrick and Rosalind eventually got married and had ten kids.  
			 
			 Bananaman was worshipped as a hero for millennia, and the CK became, as he should be, no more than a scary bedtime story.
			 
			 I would like to say that Friedrick, Rosalind, and Larry all lived happily forever after, but things like that only happen in storybooks written by people with names like "The brothers Grimm" and "Hans Andersen".  Therefore, since this is an actual story that happened to real people, I cannot say that, since things like spilled milk, broken bones, and stubbed toes, happen.  I can only say that they lived as happy and carefree as people can without becoming ridiculous and a cliche.
			 
			 
			                                                                                                                                                                                      THE END
