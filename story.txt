[Plot - climax]
--As the dreaded ketchup packet army approached, enraged by the death of thier leader, The Condiment King, prepared to avenge him at all costs. Fredrick, Rosalind, and Banana Man drew their chocolate swords to make a final stand. --Larry stood from a distance, watching the battle play out. One moment it appeared the ketchup army won at last, then the mighty threesome would rise again beating back the seemingly multiplying army. Content with his position, Larry made his move. Catupults rolled into the battlefield, knocking down candy apple trees, trampling licorice fields, until finally they reached thier destination. Fredrick and his friends, to busy fighting for thier lives, didn't notice the machines around them. Loaded with Jawbreakers, Larry commanded his men to rain fire. --Banana Man, fighting with a sharpened Ring Pop now, saw the incoming destruction. Realizing all was lost, Banana Man made a desparate attempt to save his friends. Jumping up, Banana Man would take the blow and prevent it from hitting Fredrick and Rosalind. The blow never came. The Ketchup army stopped. All was silent. --The Condiment King, had spent days in a pit of boiling caramel. With nothing to do but think, The Condiment King realized his mistakes. Swimming free of the confining carraige of caramel, The Condiment King sprinted to the battlefield to make things right. --Blasting away the Jawbreakers, The Condiment King saved Banana Man, Fredrick, and Rosalind. The Ketchup army, baffled by the sight of their leader back from the dead laid down their weapons. Larry, however, was outraged. He had already defeated The Condiment King once, and now he wouuld have to do so again. Knowing he was desperatly outmatched, Larry fled to fight another day.
