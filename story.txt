Banana man was now selling bananas at such a furious rate that even with Friedrick and Larry helping they were getting swamped. Condiment king looked on jealously, orderingRoslind to put more dill relish on the candy canes. Unfortunately 
nobody seemed to like this combo except his faithful sister Roslind who assured him it was delicious. Since theCondiment King hadn't eaten any condiments in years he couldn't know for himself. Roslind had been trying to get him to taste his own wares but as usual he refused.
Just then Larry screamed in triumph across the court and, roused from his musings, Condiment king looked up in time to see Larry disintegrate the poor banana he was holding in his claw by breathing a 10 foot tongue of fire at Condiment King's 
mustard shaped food truck. Condiment king felt the wave of heat across the courtyardand frowning angrily, snapped his 
licorice whip. Larry, being a coward at heart, yelped and attempted to crawl into the banana food truck. His wings being as 
long as he was tall, knocked over tables and chairs and shook the truck as he flailed them around uselessly. People were
shrieking and running trying to avoid his wings and his sharp tail barbs. In the span of a few minutes Larry had singlehandedly destroyed most of the furniture and dented many trucks. People were glaring at CondimentKing whispering that he had been 
the one who started this. Banana Man looked at him, a frown darkening his usually jolly countanence. He stood up, and leaning heavily on his candy cane, hobbled through the crowds who reverently parted to let the fabled hero pass. Condiment king, 
tiring of the scorn, scowled and snapped his fingers. Banana man disappeared while a gaping hole opened where he had been standing. The crowd gasped and raised their eyes as one to the satisfied Condiment King. Larry, who had been hiding under the truck. screamed in rage and overcoming his cowerdice, flew wildly at the Condiment King breathing long tongues of flame. The Crowd, heartened by the dragon's loyalty roared and surged forward joined by Friedrick, Larry's brother. Condiment King smiled.
