And What Happened After:
      The Return of the Condiment King
      The Further Adventures In Candiland As Followed the Wild Adventure detailed beforehand
     
     From The Daily Diary of The Condiment King
      All Tresspassers upon my condimentish privacy shall be sprayed with ketchup, mustard, and pickle relish.
      You having been turned into a hotdog, I shall eat you with relish!
      Ha ha ha ha ha!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!
      
      Darling, dearest diary . . . . .
           After our condiment haven was nuked, I retreated into the great pickle relish factory.  I am known there as St. Pickles.  The workers welcomed me gladly.  Those silly fools who blew up our haven thought I was dead.  I made myself a bed of ketchup and a pillow of mustard, mayonnaise was my blanket.   Pickle relish constituted my clothes, and sriracha and hotsauce made a carpet by my feet.  My condimentish peace was not to last, however . . .
           
           -From the Mad Condiment Diaries, put together by Thomas  Lars, "Larry" Butterscotch, boy genius
           Address : 203 Licorice Lane, Lollipopilis, Candiland Planet, The Sweet Solar System, The Consumable Galaxy, the Universe, 
           Compiled in The Year 4000 A.D.E. (After the Discovery of Electricity) It is now the year 8000 ADE and their time is considered medieval Candiland
           
           
           Fifteen year old Rosalind Cassandra Butterscotch looked left, right, and ran.  She dragged her five-year-old brother, Larry, across the street- Caramel Lickin' Lane, and slowed to a walk on the other side.
           "We wouldn't have to walk across the street if we had a yellowmobile," Larry whined.  He had wanted a yellowmobile ever since he had heard about it from his best friend, Bananaman, who had, coincidntally, a yellowmobile.
           
           Rosalind sighed.  "Thomas Lars Butterscotch, you know we can't have a yellowmobile because we don't have enough money, okay?  Remember that you're a big brother now and you have to be responsible."
           "but Bananama-"
           Rosalind cut him off.  "just because Bananaman has it doesn't mean you get it, Larry.  Also," she sighed and stopped talking.  It was kind of pointless when she had tried to tell him many times.  Bananaman was a thirty-year-old, unmarried, crazy individual (Rosalind kept hoping that he would get married and calm down but it hadn't happened yet.), with a taste for strange cars.    He additionally thought himself a superhero, and Larry thought himself to be Bananaman's sidekick.  At five, Rosalind didn't consider him to be old enough to do such a thing, even if he was unusually smart for his age--boy genius, some called him.
           
           Even though Rosalind, Larry, and the Bananaman had saved Candiland from a villain- The Condiment King, just six months beforehand, along with another boy- a sixteen year old pilot named Friedrick David Biscotti IV, Larry had not played much of a part in it.  Larry had been four at the time, and rather oblivious to the D.B.C. (destruction by condiments) going on around him.  The only part he had played was to trip the CK, allowing Friedrick time enough to nuke the secluded Condiment Haven.  They had not spotted him since, and CK was presumed dead.  But Rosalind and Friedrick, the only sensible ones of their group, thought that the newspapers had false assumptions and were constantly on the lookout for CK.
           
           Rosalind was yanked back to the present by Larry pulling her arm.
           "Larry," she said, annoyed,"  you don't have to yank my arm out of its socket every time you want my attention."
           "It's urgent, Rosa," he told her.
           "What is it?"
           He pointed.
           In the distance, a red, yellow, greeny-white smudge could be seen against the perfect, swirled pink and white of the Candiland sky.  
           A cape could clearly be seen against the smudge.  Its bold, easy to read letters declared
           
           CONDIMENT KING
           
           Rosalind, stunned by the return of this enemy, let her gaze slide for a moment to the right of this strange sight, to see an even stranger sight.  A golden yellow figure soared through the air, emitting bananas? from its banana shaped boots.
           
           She sprang into action.  Pulling her chocolate communication device (CCD) out of her pocket and called, first 555 (the emergency number) and then Friedrick's number.
           "Hello," she babbled instantly when the CCD stopped ringing, "Reappearance of CK, help needed chop chop!  City block marmalade12!"  then she called Friedrick.
            "Friedrick, CK has reappeared."
            "Vantage point?" asked Friedrick's quiet bass voice.
            "Block marmalade12, in front of the icecream shop.  Bananaman is also on the scene."
            "Got it, on my way.  Oh..and any visible weapons?"
            "Just the usual."
            Rosalind's CCD beeped and said in Friedrick's voice "call ended".
            
            She pocketed it and began to wait for Friedrick to arrive.
            
            As she waited the CK began to throw little hand grenades made of condiments, (yes, condiments are highly radioactive and can explode if brushed the wrong way) at various places in Lollipopilis.
            
            Her hands began to sweat terribly as she watched places she loved be destroyed.
